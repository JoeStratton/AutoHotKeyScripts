# AutoHotKeyScripts
These are my auto hot key scripts for windows

SOUND - This allows me to quickly switch between my studio and gaming headphones with the numpad keys

GPU - This is a quick work around for a firmware issue on dells end with the UP2414Q 4K monitor that once in a while causes it to be recognized as two monitors split down the middle. This script tries to different methods to restart the gpu or disable/enable it.
I am not sure, but from what ive read this works because the issue is a communication error betweent he monitor and the GPU, so breaking that link temporarily solves it, usually.

MONITOR - this is just a quick configuration script for my oddball monitor layout, 1 HD and 1 4K monitor, using the multi monitor config tool's command line options.
